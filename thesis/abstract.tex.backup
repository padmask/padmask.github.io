This thesis consists of two parts. In part one of this thesis, we study the relationship between the Artin conductor and the minimal discriminant of a hyperelliptic curve. The Artin conductor and the minimal discriminant are two measures of degeneracy of the singular fiber in a family of hyperelliptic curves. In the case of elliptic curves, the Ogg-Saito formula shows that (the negative of) the Artin conductor equals the minimal discriminant. In the case of genus two curves, equality no longer holds in general, but the two invariants are related by an inequality. We investigate the relation between these two invariants for hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus. 
In part two of this thesis, we study the sizes of component groups and Tamagawa numbers of N\'{e}ron models of Jacobians using matrix tree theorems from combinatorics.
